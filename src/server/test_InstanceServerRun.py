================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: Running the Flask application with debug mode enabled in production can expose sensitive information in error messages or stack traces.
Solution: Ensure that debug mode is turned off in a production environment. This can be achieved by setting 'debug = False' or using an environment-specific configuration.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
Issue: Sensitive information such as port number is being accessed directly from the environment_config dictionary. If this dictionary is compromised, it could lead to unauthorized access.
Solution: Avoid storing sensitive information directly in dictionaries or files. Use secure methods like environment variables or secure vault services to store and access sensitive information.

Vulnerability: CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
Issue: The Flask application does not seem to have any protection against DoS attacks. An attacker could send a large number of requests, causing the server to become overloaded and unresponsive.
Solution: Implement rate limiting using Flask extensions like Flask-Limiter to protect against DoS attacks.

Vulnerability: CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function
Issue: The Flask application does not seem to have any authentication mechanism. This could allow an unauthorized user to access sensitive resources.
Solution: Implement an authentication mechanism using Flask extensions like Flask-Security or Flask-Login.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Validating the correct debug mode from environment_config
Details:
  TestName: test_debug_mode_from_environment_config
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the 'run' method is correctly setting the debug mode from the environment_config dictionary.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the environment_config with a known debug value.
  Act: Invoke the run function.
  Assert: Check if the debug mode is set correctly as per the environment_config.
Validation:
  Rationale: It is crucial to ensure that the app is running in the correct debug mode as per the configurations set in environment_config. This will help in debugging and development process.

Scenario 2: Validating the correct port from environment_config
Details:
  TestName: test_port_from_environment_config
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the 'run' method is correctly setting the port from the environment_config dictionary.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the environment_config with a known port value.
  Act: Invoke the run function.
  Assert: Check if the port is set correctly as per the environment_config.
Validation:
  Rationale: It is crucial to ensure that the app is running on the correct port as per the configurations set in environment_config. This will ensure that the application is accessible as expected.

Scenario 3: Validating the function's behavior when no environment_config is provided
Details:
  TestName: test_no_environment_config
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's behavior if there is no environment_config provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the environment_config as None or simply do not initialize it.
  Act: Invoke the run function.
  Assert: Check if the function throws an error or uses default values for debug mode and port.
Validation:
  Rationale: It is important to ensure that the function behaves as expected even when no environment_config is provided. This will ensure the robustness of the function.

Scenario 4: Validating the function's behavior when environment_config does not contain 'debug' or 'port' keys
Details:
  TestName: test_missing_keys_in_environment_config
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's behavior if the environment_config does not contain 'debug' or 'port' keys.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the environment_config without 'debug' or 'port' keys.
  Act: Invoke the run function.
  Assert: Check if the function throws an error or uses default values for missing keys.
Validation:
  Rationale: It is important to ensure that the function behaves as expected even when some keys are missing in the environment_config. This will ensure the robustness of the function.
