================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-117: Improper Output Neutralization for Logs
Issue: The application is using Flask's built-in development server. The development server is not meant to be used in a production setting. It does not provide features that a production server should have, such as the ability to limit connections or log attacks.
Solution: Use a production WSGI server instead of Flask's built-in development server. Options include Gunicorn, uWSGI, or mod_wsgi if you're using Apache.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: The application is using Flask-RESTPlus, which is no longer maintained. This could lead to potential security issues being left unpatched.
Solution: Migrate to maintained alternatives such as Flask-RESTX or Flask-ApiSpec.

Vulnerability: CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
Issue: The code snippet provided does not show where the 'environment_config' is coming from. If this configuration contains sensitive information such as API keys or database passwords, they should not be hardcoded in the code.
Solution: Use environment variables to handle sensitive data. Python's os module can be used to access environment variables in a safe manner.
