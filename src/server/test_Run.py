================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: The debug mode in Flask application is turned on. This can expose sensitive information like server configuration, source code, or other details through error messages if any unhandled exception occurs.
Solution: Turn off the debug mode when deploying to production. If debugging is required, ensure that access is properly controlled.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: The application is using a port from environment_config that could be exposed. If the port is not properly secured, it could lead to unauthorized access to the application.
Solution: Ensure that the port is secured and not publicly accessible. Use firewalls or other security groups to restrict access to the port.

Vulnerability: CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
Issue: The application uses environment_config which might contain hard-coded credentials. If the code repository is exposed, it could lead to credential leakage.
Solution: Store sensitive data like API keys, environment variables, database URIs, etc., in environment variables or use a secure vault service.

Vulnerability: CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data
Issue: The application does not seem to use HTTPS for secure communication. This can expose sensitive information in transit.
Solution: Use HTTPS for secure communication. Flask can be run with an SSL context to enable HTTPS.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test to verify if the Flask app is running with the correct debug configuration
Details:
  TestName: test_debug_configuration
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the Flask application is running with the expected debug configuration.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the environment_config with a specific debug value.
  Act: Invoke the run function.
  Assert: Check if the Flask application is running with the debug value set in the environment_config.
Validation:
  It's important to ensure that the Flask app is running with the correct debug configuration as it affects the behavior of the app, including error reporting and reloading.

Scenario 2: Test to check if the Flask app is running on the correct port
Details:
  TestName: test_port_configuration
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the Flask application is running on the expected port.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the environment_config with a specific port value.
  Act: Invoke the run function.
  Assert: Check if the Flask application is running on the port set in the environment_config.
Validation:
  Ensuring that the Flask app runs on the correct port is crucial as it affects the accessibility of the app. If the port is not correctly configured, the app might not receive any requests.

Scenario 3: Test to verify if the Flask app fails to run when the debug configuration is missing
Details:
  TestName: test_missing_debug_configuration
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the Flask application fails to run when the debug configuration is missing from the environment_config.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the environment_config without the debug value.
  Act: Invoke the run function.
  Assert: Check if an error is thrown.
Validation:
  This test is important because it ensures that the application does not start without the necessary debug configuration. This is a part of the business requirement that the application should have all the necessary configurations before it is started.

Scenario 4: Test to verify if the Flask app fails to run when the port configuration is missing
Details:
  TestName: test_missing_port_configuration
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the Flask application fails to run when the port configuration is missing from the environment_config.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the environment_config without the port value.
  Act: Invoke the run function.
  Assert: Check if an error is thrown.
Validation:
  This test is important because it ensures that the application does not start without the necessary port configuration. This is a part of the business requirement that the application should have all the necessary configurations before it is started.
