================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: The error message 'Not found' might expose sensitive information about the system's internal workings. This could help an attacker understand the system and plan further attacks.
Solution: Modify the error message to be less informative or use generic error messages. Implement a custom error handling mechanism to ensure consistency.

Vulnerability: CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')
Issue: The 'get' function does not limit the size or number of resources that can be requested, which could lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
Solution: Implement rate limiting and size limiting for requests to prevent resource exhaustion.

Vulnerability: CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function
Issue: The 'get' function does not seem to have any authentication or authorization checks, which could allow unauthorized access to sensitive data.
Solution: Implement authentication and authorization checks for this function, ensuring that only authorized users can access the data.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Successful retrieval of a book by id
Details:
  TestName: test_get_book_by_id_success
  Description: This test verifies that the get method correctly retrieves a book when provided a valid id that exists in the database.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a Book object with a known id.
  Act: Invoke the get method on the Book object, passing the known id as a parameter.
  Assert: Check that the returned result matches the known book.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the get method is working as expected when provided a valid id. The expected result is the correct book, which aligns with the function's specifications and business requirements.

Scenario 2: Unsuccessful retrieval of a book by id
Details:
  TestName: test_get_book_by_id_failure
  Description: This test verifies that the get method returns a "Not found" message and a 404 status code when provided an id that does not exist in the database.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a Book object.
  Act: Invoke the get method on the Book object, passing an id that does not exist in the database as a parameter.
  Assert: Check that the returned result is a tuple containing the "Not found" message and a 404 status code.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the get method handles non-existent ids correctly. The expected result is a "Not found" message and a 404 status code, which aligns with the function's specifications and business requirements.

Scenario 3: Retrieval of a book by id with no books in the database
Details:
  TestName: test_get_book_by_id_empty_database
  Description: This test verifies that the get method returns a "Not found" message and a 404 status code when the database is empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a Book object with an empty database.
  Act: Invoke the get method on the Book object, passing any id as a parameter.
  Assert: Check that the returned result is a tuple containing the "Not found" message and a 404 status code.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the get method handles an empty database correctly. The expected result is a "Not found" message and a 404 status code, which aligns with the function's specifications and business requirements.
