================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
Issue: The `put` function updates a match using the `api.payload` without sanitizing it, potentially leading to SQL injection if the payload contains malicious SQL code.
Solution: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection. Also, validate and sanitize the `api.payload` before using it.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The `put` function does not validate the `id` parameter, which can lead to unexpected behavior or errors if an invalid `id` is provided.
Solution: Implement checks to validate the `id` parameter before using it. This could include checking that it is not null, and that it is of the correct type and within the expected range of values.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: The `put` function returns the `match` object directly, which could potentially expose sensitive information if the object contains such information.
Solution: Implement a method to filter or redact sensitive information from the `match` object before returning it.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Updating an existing book with valid payload
Details:
  TestName: test_put_existing_book_valid_payload
  Description: This test verifies that the put method updates an existing book's details correctly when provided with a valid payload.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a book object with a particular id and add it to the database. Prepare a valid payload with updated book details.
  Act: Call the put method with the id of the existing book and the prepared payload.
  Assert: Check if the returned book object has the updated details from the payload and the same id as the one passed to the put method.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test is important to verify that the put method correctly updates an existing book's details when provided with a valid payload. This is a fundamental requirement for the functionality of the book management system.

Scenario 2: Updating a non-existing book
Details:
  TestName: test_put_non_existing_book
  Description: This test verifies that the put method returns None when trying to update a book that does not exist in the database.
Execution:
  Arrange: Make sure there is no book with a particular id in the database.
  Act: Call the put method with the id of the non-existing book and a valid payload.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is None.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test is important to verify that the put method correctly handles the case when trying to update a non-existing book. It should return None in this case, indicating that no book was updated.

Scenario 3: Updating an existing book with empty payload
Details:
  TestName: test_put_existing_book_empty_payload
  Description: This test verifies that the put method does not change the details of the existing book when provided with an empty payload.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a book object with a particular id and add it to the database. Prepare an empty payload.
  Act: Call the put method with the id of the existing book and the empty payload.
  Assert: Check if the returned book object has the same details as before and the same id as the one passed to the put method.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test is important to verify that the put method does not change the details of the existing book when provided with an empty payload. The book's details should remain the same in this case.
