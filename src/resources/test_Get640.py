================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
Issue: The 'get' function might be vulnerable to SQL injection if the 'id' parameter is not properly sanitized.
Solution: All input should be sanitized before being used in a database query. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The 'get' function does not perform any input validation on the 'id' parameter. This could lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.
Solution: Implement input validation to ensure that the 'id' parameter is in the expected format before using it.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: The 'get' function returns a 'Not found' message with a 404 status code when a match is not found. This could potentially expose sensitive information about the system's internal workings to an attacker.
Solution: Use generic error messages that do not reveal any system-specific details. Also, consider using a custom error handling function or middleware to handle all errors in a consistent manner.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test when the book id exists in the database
Details:
  TestName: test_get_existing_book
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the get function returns the correct book when a valid id is passed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Add a book with a known id to the database.
  Act: Invoke the get function with the known id.
  Assert: Check that the returned book matches the one added to the database.
Validation:
  Rationale: The function should correctly fetch a book when a valid id is provided. The expected result is directly related to the function's purpose of retrieving a book from the database.

Scenario 2: Test when the book id does not exist in the database
Details:
  TestName: test_get_non_existing_book
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the get function returns a "Not found" message and a 404 error when an id that does not exist in the database is passed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure there is no book with a given id in the database.
  Act: Invoke the get function with the id.
  Assert: Check that the returned message is "Not found" and the status code is 404.
Validation:
  Rationale: The function should correctly handle the case where a book is not found. This is important for providing useful feedback to the client and maintaining the integrity of the API.

Scenario 3: Test when the id passed is None
Details:
  TestName: test_get_book_with_none_id
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the get function returns a "Not found" message and a 404 error when None is passed as an id.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement is needed for this test.
  Act: Invoke the get function with None as the id.
  Assert: Check that the returned message is "Not found" and the status code is 404.
Validation:
  Rationale: The function should correctly handle the case where None is passed as an id. This is important for preventing potential issues related to null references.
