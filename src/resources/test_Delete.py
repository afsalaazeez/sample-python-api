================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Improper use of global variable
Issue: The code uses a global variable 'books_db', which can be manipulated by any function. This can lead to data inconsistency and potentially data leakage if the variable is misused or altered in an insecure manner.
Solution: Avoid using global variables. Instead, encapsulate the data within a class or use a database to store data. If a global variable is necessary, make sure to control and validate its access and modification.

Vulnerability: Potential for SQL Injection
Issue: The 'id' parameter in the 'delete' function is directly used in a filter function without any validation. This could lead to SQL Injection if the 'id' parameter can be controlled by the user.
Solution: Always sanitize and validate user inputs. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to interact with the database.

Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
Issue: The 'id' parameter in the 'delete' function could be prone to IDOR, which allows attackers to bypass authorization and directly access resources in the system.
Solution: Implement proper access controls. Verify if the user is authorized to access or modify the data before performing the operation.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Validate successful deletion of a book
Details:
  TestName: test_delete_book_success
  Description: This test is intended to verify the successful deletion of a book from the books_db.
Execution:
  Arrange: Add a book with a specific id to the books_db.
  Act: Call the delete function with the id of the book added.
  Assert: Check if the returned match is equal to the book added and the books_db does not contain the book anymore.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test: This test is important to ensure that the delete function correctly deletes a book from the books_db. The expected result is that the book is no longer in the books_db and the deleted book's data is returned. This aligns with the function's specification and the business requirement to be able to delete a book.

Scenario 2: Validate deletion of a book that does not exist
Details:
  TestName: test_delete_book_not_exist
  Description: This test is intended to verify the behavior of the delete function when trying to delete a book that does not exist in the books_db.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure the books_db is empty or the id provided does not match any book in the books_db.
  Act: Call the delete function with an id that does not exist in the books_db.
  Assert: Check if the returned match is None and the books_db is unchanged.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test: This test is important to ensure that the delete function handles the case where a book does not exist in the books_db. The expected result is that the function returns None and leaves the books_db unchanged. This aligns with the function's specification and the business requirement to handle non-existent books.

Scenario 3: Validate deletion of a book from a database with multiple books
Details:
  TestName: test_delete_book_multiple_books
  Description: This test is intended to verify the delete function's behavior when there are multiple books in the books_db.
Execution:
  Arrange: Add multiple books to the books_db.
  Act: Call the delete function with the id of one of the books.
  Assert: Check if the returned match is equal to the deleted book and the books_db does not contain the book anymore but still contains the other books.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test: This test is important to ensure that the delete function correctly deletes a book from the books_db without affecting other books. The expected result is that the book is no longer in the books_db, the other books are still in the books_db, and the deleted book's data is returned. This is consistent with the function's specification and the business requirement to be able to delete a specific book without affecting others.
