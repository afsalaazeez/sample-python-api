================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
Issue: The endpoint '/books/<int:id>' allows direct access to objects based on their ID. This could potentially allow unauthorized users to access sensitive data.
Solution: Implement access control checks to ensure that the user is authorized to access the specific book ID.

Vulnerability: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
Issue: Data received via api.payload is directly appended to the books_db without any form of sanitization or encoding. This could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks if the data is reflected on a web page.
Solution: Ensure that any data received from the user is properly sanitized and encoded before use. Consider using libraries that automatically escape user input, such as Jinja2 for rendering templates.

Vulnerability: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
Issue: The code does not validate or sanitize the 'id' parameter of the '/books/<int:id>' endpoint. This could lead to path traversal attacks, allowing an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server.
Solution: Validate and sanitize the 'id' parameter to ensure it does not contain path traversal sequences. Use an allowlist of valid inputs whenever possible.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing if the new book is correctly added to the database
Details:
  TestName: test_add_book_to_database
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the new book is correctly added to the database with the correct id and payload.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a payload with book details. Ensure the books_db is not empty.
  Act: Invoke the post function with the payload.
  Assert: Check if the new book is added to the books_db with the correct id and payload.
Validation:
  Rationale: It's important to verify that the function correctly adds new books to the database, as this is its primary function. The expected result is directly related to the function's requirement to add new books.

Scenario 2: Testing if the first book is correctly added to an empty database
Details:
  TestName: test_add_first_book_to_empty_database
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the first book is correctly added to an empty database with id 0.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a payload with book details. Ensure the books_db is empty.
  Act: Invoke the post function with the payload.
  Assert: Check if the new book is added to the books_db with id 0 and correct payload.
Validation:
  Rationale: It's important to verify that the function correctly handles the case where the database is empty. The expected result is directly related to the function's requirement to handle an empty database.

Scenario 3: Testing if the book id is correctly incremented
Details:
  TestName: test_increment_book_id
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the new book's id is correctly incremented based on the last book's id in the database.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a payload with book details. Ensure the books_db is not empty and note down the last book's id.
  Act: Invoke the post function with the payload.
  Assert: Check if the new book is added to the books_db with id incremented by 1 from the last book's id.
Validation:
  Rationale: It's crucial to verify that the function correctly increments the book id, as this ensures that each book has a unique id. The expected result is directly related to the function's requirement to assign unique ids to each book.
