================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: The code does not handle exceptions, potentially revealing sensitive information in error messages.
Solution: Implement try/except blocks to handle exceptions and prevent the exposure of sensitive information in error messages.

Vulnerability: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
Issue: The use of flask_restplus can lead to XSS attacks if user input is not properly sanitized.
